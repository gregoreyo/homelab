# Homelab

Welcome to my Homelab repository! This space is a comprehensive overview of my homelab, including hardware specifications, software configurations, network diagrams, and project details.

This repository is a living document as I experiment with new technologies, refine existing setups, and tackle new challenges. My goal is to create a resource that helps me maintain my homelab and provides valuable insights and examples for others looking to build or expand their own environments.
